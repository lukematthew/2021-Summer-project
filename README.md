Experiments with particle tracking 

Main aim of project:
There are two types of ocean surface velocity data - model derived data and satellite(observational) based data. It is not well known what kind of differences
there are between them, so we have tried running some simulations. 
One idea was to put the same set of particles through both models, and see how long it would take each pair of particles released at the same point to reach a 
certain separation, and plot this on a map. 
Another experiment was to set 'gates' at points of interest around Africa, and only plot the trajectories of the particles which go through these gates. These
can be seen in the "Gate trajectories" folder. 
This was expanded in Aug16.py, where more particles were released in a greater number of releases over a longer period. This data was used in analysis.py where 
things like the mean time to get to each gate were calculated, and relationships between the different gates could be seen as seasonal relationships. 
The locations of the gates can be seen at:
