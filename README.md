Experiments with particle tracking 

Main aim of project:
There are two types of ocean surface velocity data - model derived data and satellite(observational) based data. It is not well known what kind of differences
there are between them, so we have tried running some simulations. 
One idea was to put the same set of particles through both models, and see how long it would take each pair of particles released at the same point to reach a 
certain separation, and plot this on a map.
